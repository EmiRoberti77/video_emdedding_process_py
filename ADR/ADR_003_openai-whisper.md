GOVERNOR, THANKS FOR BEING WITH US ON THE PROGRAM. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE YOU HERE TOGETHER IN OUR HOME STATE, IF NOT TOGETHER, AT LEAST BOTH HERE IN THE LONE STAR STATE. TELL ME WHAT WE'RE SEEING DOWN THERE AT THE BORDER. WE'VE HEARD THE NUMBERS DOWN 90% LITERALLY APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN BORDER FROM THE MEXICAN SIDE, WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE MEXICAN OR CENTRAL AMERICAN OR HAITIAN OR WHEREVER THEY ARE FROM, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING APPROACH AMERICA'S SOUTHERN BORDER? I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A MASSIVE DROP IN ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION EVER. YOU KNOW, I THINK PRESIDENT TRUMP HAD THE BEST LINE WHEN HE SAID THAT TO SECURE THE BORDER, TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM, WE DIDN'T NEED NEW LAWS, WE JUST NEEDED A NEW PRESIDENT. AND ONCE HE GOT ELECTED PRESIDENT, IT LED TO A SUDDEN HALT AND PEOPLE CROSSING THE BORDER ILLEGALLY. THE DOWNTURN HAS BEEN SO DRAMATIC. WE'RE JUST SEEING A TRICKLE OF PEOPLE A DAY. YOU'RE SHOWING THOSE FILMS. THOSE FILMS ARE UNDER THE BITE ADMINISTRATION. THERE'S JUST A TRICKLE OF PEOPLE A DAY. AND I AM TOLD THAT OF THE PEOPLE WHO DO MAKE IT ACROSS, MOST OF THEM ARE ACTUALLY RETURNED. THERE'S ONLY BEEN A FEW DOZEN OR SO THAT ARE EVEN ALLOWED TO STAY IN THE UNITED STATES. AND THAT LEADS TO EXACTLY WHAT SECRETARY NOAM WAS TALKING ABOUT. AND THAT IS WHEN PEOPLE GO THROUGH THE TIME, THE MONEY, AND THE HORRORS OF MAKING THE WAY TO THE UNITED STATES BORDER AND THEN GET HERE ONLY TO REALIZE THEY'RE BEING SENT BACK. THAT DETERRS OTHERS FROM COMING HERE IN THE FUTURE. RIGHT. WE'RE SEEING THE POWER OF DETERRENCE AND INCENTIVE. REST ASSURED, GOVERNOR, THOSE VIDEOS ON OUR SCREEN RIGHT NOW ARE DATED AND THE AUDIENCE WELL UNDERSTANDS WHAT'S HAPPENED WITH ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OVER THE LAST THREE TO FOUR MONTHS. I DO WANT TO ASK YOU, NOT UNLIKE ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, ABOUT A COUPLE OF ISSUES HERE IN TEXAS THAT BECOME SYMBOLIC PERHAPS OF ISSUES FOR THE REST OF THE NATION. YOU RECENTLY SIGNED A BILL ESSENTIALLY BANNING CAPITAL GAINS TAX HERE IN THE STATE. THAT'S A BIG MOVEMENT. THAT IS A BIG MOMENT. WHAT DOES IT MEAN? DOES THAT MEAN ANY STOCK TRANSACTIONS? WE DON'T HAVE INCOME TAX IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. IS IT PROPERTY TAXES? HOW DOES IT WORK? WE'RE GOING TO BAN CAPITAL GAINS TAX IN TEXAS. THE LATEST ITERATION OF WHAT WE HAVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. IT'S NOT A LAW. IT'S A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. WHAT THAT MEANS, WILL, FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, IT WOULD REQUIRE A TWO-THIRDS VOTE TO CHANGE THAT AND THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN. SO WE HAVE CONSTITUTIONALLY BANNED AN INCOME TAX, NOW A CAPITAL GAINS TAX AND THEN A TRANSACTIONS TAX. YOU'RE UP IN THE DALLAS AREA. YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON UP THERE WHERE WE HAVE ALL THE STOCK EXCHANGES. WE HAVE A BAN ON THE TRANSACTIONS TAX. WE HAVE A BAN ON THE TRANSACTIONS TAX. WE HAVE A BAN ON THE STOCK EXCHANGES, THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE, THE NASDAQ AND NOW THE TEXAS STOCK EXCHANGE. AND NOW WITH THE BAN ON A TRANSACTIONS TAX, THAT MAKES TEXAS THE MOST HOSPITABLE HOME TO BUSINESSES AS WELL AS ESPECIALLY STOCK EXCHANGE BUSINESSES. SO IT'S CONSTITUTIONALLY SETTING US UP FOR THE FUTURE. NO INCOME TAX, NO CAPITAL GAINS TAX, MAKING IT AS YOU MENTIONED EPPIC CITY. MANY OF OUR VIEWERS KNOW IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE COVERED IN DEPTH HERE ON THE WILL CAIN SHOW. YOU PUT OUT A NOTICE ABOUT A WEEK AGO SUGGESTING ALL CONSTRUCTION WAS HALTED. I DO HAVE TO PRESS YOU ON THIS, GOVERNOR. YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OF BLOWBACK ON THIS. I DID HAVE A GUESS TO SAY THERE IS NO CONSTRUCTION AT EPIC CITY. EPIC CITY IS THE ISLAMIC DEVELOPMENT CENTERED AROUND A MOSQUE. THEY SAY THAT IT IS OPEN TO BELIEVERS OF ALL FAITH. THEY SAY THEY WILL NOT CONSTRUCTION. YOU ARE NOT IN THE CITY. YOU ARE NOT IN THE CITY. YOU ARE NOT IN THE CITY. IT IS IN THE CITY. IT IS INVESTIGATED BY YOU, ATTORNEY GENERAL KEN PAXTON, BY THE DOJ. BUT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE? IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING NO CONSTRUCTION HAS BEEN HALTED BECAUSE NO CONSTRUCTION HAS STARTED AT EPIC CITY. SURE. EASY TO CLARIFY, WILL. FIRST OF ALL, THOSE IMAGES YOU ARE SHOWING, THEY ARE IMAGES THAT PEOPLE HAVE SEEN ON SOCIAL MEDIA. WE ARE SEEING AROUND THAT IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN IMAGES ON A PIECE OF PAPER. THEY DON'T EXIST IN REALITY. AND THE AREA THEY ARE SEEKING TO DEVELOP IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EMPTY FIELD RIGHT NOW. THAT SAID, AS YOU WOULD KNOW, AS ANY ECONOMIC DEVELOPPER WOULD KNOW, WHEN YOU DEVELOP A LARGE TRACT OF LAND, YOU DON'T JUST IMMEDIATELY START TURNING DIIRT. YOU GO THROUGH THE PROMOTION PROCESS AND THEN THE PERMITTING PROCESS. AND THOSE ARE AREAS WHERE TEXAS HAS STEPPED IN TO PUT A STOP TO THIS. WHAT WE FOUND ARE ALLEGATIONS OF ILLEGALITY. AND THOSE ARE BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE TEXAS RANGERS, BY OTHER AUTHORITIES IN THE STATE OF TEXAS. SO MUCH SO WILL THAT THE ORIGINAL PROMOTION OF THIS PROJECT HAD TO BE CHANGED AND WE BELIEVE CHANGED BECAUSE OF ILLEGAL CONDUCT IN THE PAST. SECOND THING, WITH REGARD OF THE PERMITS, LISTEN, THE TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY IN THE STATE OF TEXAS SAID THAT NO AUTHORITY EXISTS FOR ANY CONSTRUCTION TO GO FORWARD WHEN THEY DO MAKE A DECISION TO MOVE FORWARD. THERE IS A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER BY A STATE AGENCY AS WELL AS ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE TEXAS FAIR HOUSING ACT AND THEN IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE THE TEXAS ATTORNEY GENERAL AS WELL AS NOW THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE ALL CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS TO ENSURE THIS PROJECT IS STUCK DEAD IN ITS TRACKS. OKAY. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A DEEPER CONVERSATION WITH YOU, A LONGER CONVERSATION WITH YOU ABOUT THIS IN THE FUTURE. THERE'S OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT I THINK ARE WORTH DISCUSSION. THIS IS HAPPENING NOT JUST IN TEXAS. IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED TO ME AS WELL IN MICHIGAN AND OTHER PLACES. SO I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF A DEEPER DISCUSSION. BUT FOR THE TIME WE HAVE TODAY, I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU ONE MORE THING. AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO SPEAK TO YOU SINCE SHE SORT OF MADE NEWS SAYING THIS. AND I DON'T MEAN THIS GRATUITOUSLY, BUT I THINK I WANTED TO ASK YOUR REACTION. CONGRESSWOMAN JASMINE CROCKETT FROM DALLAS HAS ON A DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPAL. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPAL. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEMOCRATIC PARTICIPAL. YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DEMOCRATIC REFERRED TO YOU AS GOVERNOR HOT WHEELS. I'M JUST CURIOUS, HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL? WELL, TO BE HONEST, IT MAKES ME FEEL GOOD ABOUT THE PROSPECTS OF REPUBLICANS WINNING ELECTIONS. BECAUSE WHAT YOU CAN SEE BY COMMENTS LIKE THAT IS DEMOCRATS, THEY HAVE NO POLICY, THEY HAVE NO IDEAS. THEY ARE DEVOID OF ALL OF THOSE. THEY ARE NOT DELIVERING ANYTHING FOR THEIR CONSTITUENTS OTHER THAN HOT TOPICS. AND WHAT WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO AS REPUBLICANS IN THE STATE OF TEXAS, WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO WIN ELECTIONS BECAUSE THE JASMINE CRACKETS AND THE DEMOCRATS WHO ARE ACTING LIKE HER, THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE VOTERS AND THEY ARE GOING TO LOSE ELECTIONS. MY SUSPICIEN IS IT'S NOT JUST TEXAS BUT IT WILL BE ALL ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. GOVERNOR ABBOTT, THANKS SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US HERE TODAY. MY PLEASURE. THE WILL CANE PODCAST FOR FULL EPISODES RIGHT NOW.

i run an other test using the tiny model

```python
def transcribe_audio():
    """transcribe audio to text using whisper"""
    model = whisper.load_model("tiny")
    result = model.transcribe(constants.AUDIO_FILE_IN)
    print(result["text"])
```

this is the output and took about 10 seconds

Governor, thanks for being with us on the program. It's great to have you here together in our home state, if not together, at least both here in the Lone Star State. Tell me what we're seeing down there at the border. We've heard the numbers down 90% literally approaching the Southern border from the Mexican side, with not their Mexican or Central American or Haitian or wherever they are from. What are you seeing approach America's Southern border? I've never seen such a massive drop in illegal immigration ever. You know, I think President Trump had the best line when he said that to secure the border to change the system, we didn't need new laws, we just needed a new president. And once he got elected president, it led to a sudden halt and people crossing the border illegally. The downturn has been so dramatic. We're just seeing a trickle of people that you're showing those films, those films, or under the bottom administration. There's just a trickle of people that they and I am told that people who do make it across, most of them are actually returned. There's only been a few dozen or so that are even allowed to stay in the United States. And that leads to exactly what Secretary Noom was talking about. And that is, when people go through the time the money and the horrors of making the way to the United States border, and then get here, only to rely there being sent back. That deterres others from coming here in the future. We're seeing the power of deterrence and incentive. Rest assured, Governor, those videos on our screen are now our data and the audience well understands what's happened with illegal immigration over the last three to four months. I do want to ask you not unlike illegal immigration about a couple of issues here in Texas that becomes symbolic, perhaps, of issues for the rest of the nation. You recently signed a bill essentially banning capital gains tax here in the state. That's a big movement. That is a big moment. What does it mean? Does that mean any stock transactions? We don't have income tax in the state of Texas? Is it property taxes? How do you, how does it work? We're going to ban capital gains tax in Texas. Well, so the latest iteration of what we have constitutionally, and it's not a law, it's a constitutional amendment. And what that means will for the rest of your life in the state of Texas, it would require two-thirds vote to change that. And that's not going to happen. So we've constitutionally banned in income tax, a now-capital of gains tax, and then a transaction tax. You're up in the Dallas area. You know what's going on up there where we have all the stock exchanges, the New York Stock Exchange, the NASDAQ, and now the Texas Stock Exchange, and now with the ban on a transaction tax, that makes Texas the most hospitable home to businesses, as well as especially stock exchange businesses. So it's constitutionally setting us up for the future, no income tax, no capital gains tax, making it, as you mentioned, the y'all street movement here in Dallas, of the Texas Stock Exchange, even more appealing. I want to ask you about Epic City. Many of our viewers know it's something we've covered in depth here on the Wilcane Show. You put out a notice about a week ago suggesting all construction was halted. I do have to press you on this governor. You've got a little bit of blowback on this. I did have a guest to say, there is no construction at Epic City. Epic City is the Islamic development centered around a mosque. They say that it is open to believers of all faiths. They say they will not implement Sharia law. It is being investigated by you, Attorney General Ken Paxton, by the DOJ. But what has been done is my understanding no construction has been halted, because no construction has started at Epic City. Sure. Easy to clarify, will. First of all, those images you're showing, they are images that people have seen on social media. And people have been led to believe that that actually exists. And those are nothing more than images on a piece of paper that don't exist at reality. And the area they're seeking to develop is nothing more than an empty field right now. That's that, however, will is, as you would know, as any economic developer would know, when you develop a large tract of land, you don't just immediately start turning dirt, you go through the promotion process, and then the permitting process. And those are areas where Texas has stepped in to put a stop to this. And the promotion process, what we found, are allegations of illegality. And those are being investigated by the Texas Rangers, by other authorities in the state of Texas. So much so will that the original promotion of this project had to be changed, and we believe change because of illegal conduct in the past. Second thing with the regard of the permits. Listen, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality and State of Texas said that no authority exists for any construction to go forward when they do make a decision to move forward. There is a cease-indicist order by a state agency, as well as alleged violations of the Texas Fair Housing Act. And then in addition to that, we have the Texas Attorney General, as well as now the United States Department of Justice all conducting investigations to ensure this project is stuck dead in its tracks. OK, I would love to have a deeper conversation with you, longer conversation, with you about this in the future. There's other developments that I think are worth discussion. And this is happening not just in Texas. It's been highlighted to me as well in Michigan and other places. So I think it's worthy of a deeper discussion. But for the time we have today, I just want to ask you one more thing. And I haven't gotten to speak to you. Since she sort of made news saying this. And I don't mean this gratuitously, but I think I wanted to ask your reaction. Congresswoman Jasmine Crocket from Dallas has, on a stage, referred to you as Governor Hot Wheels. And I'm just curious, how does that make you feel? Well, to be honest, it makes me feel good about the prospects of Republicans winning elections because what you can see by comments like that is Democrats that they have no policy, they have no ideas. They're devoid of all of those. And all they can do is raise controversial claims like this. What that means is they are not delivering anything for their constituents other than hot topics. And what we are going to be able to do is Republicans in the Texas, we're going to be able to win elections because the Jasmine Crocket said that Democrats who are acting like they're going to lose voters and they're going to lose elections. And that's a suspicion is it's not just Texas, but we all across the United States. Governor Abbott, thanks so much for being with us here today. My pleasure. Hey, it's Will Kane.
