  - Exact timestamp where matched content begins
  - Duration of the matched segment
  - Transcribed text of the matched segment
  - Confidence/similarity score
  - Context (surrounding text before and after the match)

**FR-008: Video Playback Integration**

- The system shall provide direct links or commands to start video playback at the specified timestamp
- The system shall support integration with common video players
- The system shall highlight or indicate the matched audio segment during playback
- The system shall allow users to jump between multiple matches within the same video

### 2.5 Data Management Module

**FR-009: Content Storage**

- The system shall store processed video metadata, transcriptions, and embeddings in a searchable database
- The system shall maintain relationships between video files, audio segments, transcriptions, and embeddings
- The system shall support incremental updates when new videos are added
- The system shall handle duplicate video detection

**FR-010: Index Management**

- The system shall create and maintain search indices for efficient query processing
- The system shall support index rebuilding and optimization
- The system shall provide backup and recovery capabilities for search indices

## 3. Performance Requirements

### 3.1 Processing Performance
